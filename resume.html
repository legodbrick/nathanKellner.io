<p id ="personalSummary">I am an Engineering Student at Virginia Polytechnical Institute. 
I am also a recent graduate of Virginia Wester Community College, where I graduated summa cum laude with an associate’s degree in engineering with a specialization in computer science.
I was able to acquire the majority of the credits required for my associate’s degree before my high school graduation in May of 2019. I am a tutor at Virginia Western’s “Stem Center”, 
where I help students understand concepts from basic algebra to multi-variable calculus.
I am also often contracted as an actor by Roanoke Children’s Theatre. RCT is a non-profit professional theatre that performs for children and teens. 
This past summer, I worked as a computer technician at The VR Center, where I worked on hardware repairs and set up implement a number of simulation tools.</p>

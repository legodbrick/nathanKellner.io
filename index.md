<p id ="personalSummary">I am an Engineering Student at Virginia Polytechnical Institute. I am also a recent graduate of Virginia Wester Community College, where I graduated <br>
summa cum laude with an associate’s degree in engineering with a specialization in computer science.<br>
I was able to acquire the majority of the credits required for my associate’s degree before my high school graduation in May of 2019. I am a tutor at Virginia Western’s “Stem Center”, <br>
